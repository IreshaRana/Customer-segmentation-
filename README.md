## Observations and Recommendations

### Observations
Using the K-Means clustering algorithm, the analysis identified **three distinct customer clusters** based on age and purchase behavior:  
- **Cluster 0**: Older customers, moderately frequent buyers.  
- **Cluster 1**: Mid-aged customers, least frequent buyers.  
- **Cluster 2**: Younger customers, frequent buyers.

### Recommendations
Based on the clustering analysis, the following strategies are proposed:  
1. **Cluster 2 (Younger, Frequent Buyers)**:
   - Offer personalized product recommendations to enhance engagement and loyalty.  
2. **Cluster 1 (Mid-aged, Least Frequent Buyers)**:
   - Develop targeted discount campaigns to encourage more frequent purchases.
